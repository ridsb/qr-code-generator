# QR Code Generator

This Python script generates a QR code based on user-inputted links. It utilizes the `qrcode` library to create QR codes with customization options.

This is the qr generated by this code of my github profile.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install qrcode[pil]
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python qr_generator.py
   ```

3. Enter the link when prompted.

4. The script will generate a QR code image in the same directory with the name `test.png`.

## Customization

You can customize the QR code appearance by modifying the script parameters. For example, you can adjust the `version`, `box_size`, and `border` in the `qrcode.QRCode` object to change the QR code's size and appearance.

```python
qr = qrcode.QRCode(
    version=15,
    box_size=10,
    border=5,
)
```

Feel free to modify the script according to your specific requirements.
